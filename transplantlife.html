					<p>Hi, My Name is Patty</p><p>July 2018 was a <em>life changing</em> month for my 4-legged cherub, "Mocha," and I. This web page consists of my stories, trials, tribulations and shenanighans while deciding to go cross country, the trip itself and what I found when I landed in Colorado.</p> <p>This also is the first web page I have ever created on my own, from scratch, so I am going to utilize it to showcase my front-end development and web design skills. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/PR10100" target="_BLANK"> alt="GitHub profile">GitHub profile</a> for my <a href="https://github.com/PR10100/100-days-of-code" target="_BLANK"> alt="100 Days of Code Challenge">100 Days of Code Challenge</a> that is part of this journey. You can also view details of that learning journey here (linked to another page within my website - coming soon!).</p><p>Happy Reading!</p><p>Cheers!<br>Patty &amp; Mocha (find an emoji symbol for dog paw)
